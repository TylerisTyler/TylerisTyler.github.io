<h2>My Family</h2>
<p>My biological mother was a drug a addict and my father left to another state so now I live with my Grandmother and my Grandfather but I like to think of them as my mom and dad because they took care of me since I was born and before I was born they got me in school and a docter I also have three turtles they said they would die because of sandy my mothers sister they threw the turtles in the air and they had a heart attack the turtles but mine are living strong for 5 years.</p>

<h2>My skills</h2>

<p>I am very good at coding I coded a website about dogs another one about anytown USA I am also good at gaming I can finish a game in at least one day.The reason why I want to really be a game designer is because it includes what I like to do and it is a job but then if that does not work out then I will try to be a game tester it pays good and you get to play games for a living.</p>
